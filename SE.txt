test Lab
create folder
may 2013 releases
test set build 213
diff tabs like
details execution grid
execution flow
attachments
linked defects
details   : login and reg tests
execution grid :Select tests 
show all tests and select the login n reg tests
select a test suppose invalid login
click on run button
deails of all step
execute them manual and select pass/fail for every step
give actaul result vs the expected ones
stop run
even if a single step fail the whole test is failed
if invalid login suppose is failed
go to req taba abd refresh, you will now see the
status as failed in req tab also
becuse this test was linked with reqin this way all 3 modules are connected
also you can select responsible tester for testsand planned dates and times
execution date and time will come when you run the test

project manager first has to change the status of this defect to open
-------------------------------------
developer logs in check the defect fixes ithe can give comments that fixed itand change status to fixedalso actual fix time req he can give

tester again logs in retests the bugif really done changes status to close
delsere
open
also while closed he can mention closing dateand give his comments by add comment

when any item is created in unixa corresponding datastructure is created for itthat data structure stores all the info abou that item.it is called as inodeinodes are created on disk.and they are arranged in  array.they have index and do not have nameswhen a file is deleted the inode location in the inode array is freeinode contains:typesizelocationref countlast modifiedlast accssedowner idgroup idaccess rights
